    FEST-C Version 2.0 (US EPA)

    Linux installation:
    ===================
	
	Copy the Linux release file festc_2.0_linux_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz and uncompress it
    into a directory using the following command:

	cd /usr/local
	tar -xzvf festc_2.0_linux_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz

    The above command will create a subdirectory festc_2.0 and hold the whole fest-c package.

    	cd festc_2.0
        vi festc.sh

    At the editing mode of vi, change the line:
	FESTC_HOME=.
    to
	FESTC_HOME=/usr/local/festc_2.0


    Run FEST-C from the Linux server:
    =================================

    	If you are connecting to the server from a Windows platform, please run Xming 
    service first, then from a command line type the following to connect to the server:
	
	putty -X your_amber_login_name@amber.nesc.epa.gov
   
    If you are connecting from a Linux machine, please make sure sshd is running and 
    then type the following to connect to amber:

	ssh -X your_amber_login_name@amber.nesc.epa.gov

    After you give your login credentials, at your home directory, create a subdirectory
    festc:
	
	mkdir festc
	cp -p /usr/local/festc_2.0/config.properties .
	vi config.properties

    At the editing mode of vi, modify the following properties with your local values 
    and save it:

    work.dir=/usr/local/username/EPIC/epic   # scenarios dir is under here
    epic.dir=/usr/local/username/EPIC/epic   # programs, utilities, and common data
    visual.program.home=/usr/local/bin
    visual.program=verdi.sh -f
    sa.home=/home/lid/sa_raster_102010/
    queue.cmd=qsub
    queue.name=workq
    queue.option=-W group_list=mod3app
 
    Then, make an alias for the fest-c path and command:

	alias festc="/usr/local/festc_2.0/festc.sh"

    You may save this line into your .bashrc file if you are running bash shell or 
    .cshrc file if your command line is a csh shell so you don't need to type them everytime
    you login to the server. Both .bashrc and .cshrc file are located in your home directory.

    At the xterm command line, type the following command will get you the fest-c GUI:
	
	festc.sh &
